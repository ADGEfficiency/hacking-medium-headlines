Used `https://towardsdatascience.com/`
- difficult parsing (classes change)

Used 'https://towardsdatascience.com/archive'
- easier :)


## Open questions

Should I bother with subtitle
- often cut off (see 2014 archive)
- if it's cut off, won't matter for engagement ...

Is parsing the high quality titles a good idea?

Claps rounded to the nearest 1,000 for large claps

Is date important?

Should the claps be normalized by TDS popularity?

# TODO

Manually check the number of articles for each page
